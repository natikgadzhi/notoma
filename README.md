## What can you do with Notoma
Notoma provides commands to: 
- Convert contents of your Notion Blog database to a bunch of Markdown files.
- *Coming soon*: Watch Notion Blog database for updates and regenerate Markdown files on any updates.
- *Coming soon*: Create a new Notion database for your Blog with all required fields.

Basic usage example: this command will convert only published posts from a Notion blog database to the `./posts/ directory`.

```bash
notoma convert --dest ./posts/
```

This example assumes that you have a `.env` config file with authentication and blog url parameters in it.

#### Authenticating in Notion

Notoma uses an internal Notion API, and that, unfortunately, requires you to provide an authentication token `token_v2` that you can find in your notion.so cookes.

You can provide `token_v2` option to every command line call, or store it in your environment, or [`.env` config file](.env.sample).

## Notion database structure
Notoma has very few expectations about how your Notion is structured. Here's a [public example database](https://www.notion.so/respawn/7b46cea379bd4d45b68860c2fa35a2d4?v=b4609f6aae0d4fc1adc65a73f72d0e21).

Notoma requires that your Notion blog database has the following **properties**:
- **Published**: whether the article is published, or is still a draft
- **Title**: Will be used to create a file name for that article's Markdown equivalent file. *Won't be used in the article itself.*

Notoma tries to parse other properties and add them as front matter into the resulting Markdown articles: 
- **Published at** will be used as publicataion date for the article, if present.
- **Categories** will be used as `categories` front matter key, so it's expected to be a **multiple choice** propery.
