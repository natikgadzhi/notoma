sync:
  # Option 1: Auto-discover all root-level pages in the workspace
  # This finds all pages/databases shared with the integration that are
  # at the workspace root level (not nested inside other pages).
  # discover_workspace_roots: true

  # Option 2: Explicitly list specific pages/databases to sync
  roots:
    # Add Notion page or database URLs here
    # Get the URL by clicking "Share" -> "Copy link" in Notion
    - url: "https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/Page-Title-abc123def456..."
      name: "My Page"  # Optional friendly name for logging

    # Database example (URLs with ?v= parameter)
    - url: "https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/abc123...?v=xyz789..."
      name: "My Database"

  # Note: You can use both options together. When discover_workspace_roots is
  # true, discovered roots will be synced in addition to any explicit roots.
