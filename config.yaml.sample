sync:
  # Option 1: Auto-discover all root-level pages in the workspace
  # This finds all pages/databases shared with the integration that are
  # at the workspace root level (not nested inside other pages).
  # Great for syncing your entire Notion workspace without manual configuration.
  discover_workspace_roots: true

  # Option 2: Explicitly list specific pages/databases to sync
  # You can use this instead of (or in addition to) discover_workspace_roots.
  # Uncomment and add your pages/databases:
  #
  # roots:
  #   # Add Notion page or database URLs here
  #   # Get the URL by clicking "Share" -> "Copy link" in Notion
  #   - url: "https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/Page-Title-abc123def456..."
  #     name: "My Page"  # Optional friendly name for logging
  #
  #   # Database example (URLs with ?v= parameter)
  #   - url: "https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/abc123...?v=xyz789..."
  #     name: "My Database"

  # Note: You can use both options together. When discover_workspace_roots is
  # true, discovered roots will be synced in addition to any explicit roots.
